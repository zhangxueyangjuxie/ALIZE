	  The NIST SPeech HEader REsources (SPHERE) Package
			     Version 2.7



To install the SPHERE package from a compressed-tar file:

	Extract the programs from the compressed-tar file then run the
	UNIX install command.  This can be accomplished on a UNIX system
	with the commands:

	    % bunzip2 -dc sphere_2.7.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
	    % cd nist
	    % sh src/scripts/install.sh

        You can then confirm that the installation process pass the built
        in tests:

            % make check


For a description of SPHERE, read the files, 'doc/sphere.rdm' and
'doc/sphere.doc'.  UNIX-style man pages can be found in 'doc/man'.

If you're linking the sphere library with code written for SPHERE
version 2.0 or 2.1, the argument calls for sp_read_data and
sp_write_data have changed.  Section VI, "Linking to the SPHERE
library" in the document "doc/sphere.doc" describe ways to use the old
code without re-writing it.

This version of SPHERE has been tested on the following platforms:

     Mac OS X (10.6)
     Linux (Ubuntu 11.04)
     Cygwin (1.7 under Windows XP)

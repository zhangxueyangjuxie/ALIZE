# This script run the core speaker verification engine 
# It assumes the existence of normalized feature files and label files, universal background model (UBM), 
# TotalVariability matrix (TV) and i-vectors
# If those files do not exist in ./data/prm/,  ./data/lbl/, ./gmm/, ./mat/, and ./iv/ please refer to other scripts provided in this tutorial:
#
# 	01_RUN_feature_extraction.sh
#	02a_RUN_spro_front-end.sh
#	03_RUN_i-vector_background.sh
#
# This script will compare i-vectors using different metrics
#
# 	Note that the output of this script (scores) are just provided for understanding of the whole process.
#	In any case they should be consider as state-of-the-art output as the system trained for this tutoriali
#	is far from state-of-the-art performance.
#	However, the configuration files provided for each executable used in this tutorial are as close as possible
#	from the state-of-the-art configuration 
#	that can be used for NIST-SRE evaluation. In this respect, those configuration files are designed 
#	to provide a good starting point.
